    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "For most real world applications we do not have enough labelled images to train a large neural network from scratch. Instead we can use a pre-trained network as a feature transformer and train a smaller model (or even just a logistic regression) on the output of the pre-trained network.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several pretrained networks available as part of keras: https://keras.io/applications/. The documentation usually gives some information or links about each network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation also contains snippets on how to use a pre-trained network as feature transformer (\"Extract features with VGG16\"). You should be able to generalise from that example using VGG16 to approximately any of the networks available there.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important thing to not forget is that you need to preprocess your images before feeding them into a pretrained network. Keras provides the functions to do that as well, use them :) You might also need to resize your images first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task for this question is to build a classifier that can tell road bikes from mountain bikes. Start with using a pre-trained network as feature transformer and logistic regression as classifier on the output of the pretrained network. Once this works you can experiment with extracting features from earlier layers of the pre-trained network, compare your performance to a small network trained from scratch, try to beat your neural net by extracting features by hand and feeding them to a random forest, increasing your dataset size by [augmenting the data](https://keras.io/preprocessing/image/), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset containing about 100 labelled images for each road and mountain bikes is here: https://github.com/wildtreetech/advanced-computing-2018/blob/master/data/road-and-mountain-bikes.zip"

    "A local bike shop wants to keep an eye on sales of bikes on ebay. They specialise in road bikes so they want to be able to filter out all adverts for mountain bikes. They have found that people writing ebay adverts are not very good at correctly labelling their adverts. Can they use machine-learning to help classify adverts?\n",
    "\n",
    "We investigate labelling adverts based on the image in the advert and study different trade offs in misclassifying bikes. The network was trained on 100 images from a catalog which show bikes on a white background. We compare the performance of the network on the training data and a small set of hand labelled images of bikes in the wild."
